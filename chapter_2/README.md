# Chapter 2 - Coding our first neurons

<!-- Overview -->
## Overview

A single neuron:
* Suppose we have an input: `inputs = [1, 2, 3]`
* Weights and biases: change during the training
  `weights = [0.2, 0.8, -0.5]`
  `bias = 2`  # only one bias value per neuron
==> Output Calculation (for individual neuron): (inputs*weights)+bias
  `output = (inputs[0] * weights[0] +
             inputs[1] * weights[1] +
             inputs[2] * weights[2] + bias)`
  `print(output)`  # result: 2.3
