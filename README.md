# Neuralnets From Scratch

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great similar repos that summarizes deep neural networks available on GitHub. Within this project, I try to build a document, showing my experience and oerview about neural nets based on the great book - Neural Networks From Scratch by Harrison Kinsley \& Daniel Kukie≈Ça (https://nnfs.io/).

Here's the workflow of my notes following each chapter:
* Taking notes which points are important.
* Code implementation for examples

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
